# Number-Game

How to play :
1. There is a 4*4 grid which can be filled with any number. Initially two random cells are filled with 2 in it. Rest cells are empty.
2. we have to press any one of four keys to move up, down, left, or right. When we press any key, the elements of the cell move in that direction such that if any two identical numbers are contained in that particular row (in case of moving left or right) or column (in case of moving up and down) they get add up and extreme cell in that direction fill itself with that number and rest cells goes empty again.
3.  After this grid compression any random empty cell gets itself filled with 2.
4.  Following the above process we have to double the elements by adding up and make 2048 in any of the cell. If we are able to do that we wins.
5.  But if during the game there is no empty cell left to be filled with a new 2, then the game goes over.
